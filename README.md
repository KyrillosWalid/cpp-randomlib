cpp-randomlib
===========

Only C++ Header file gives random (integers - strings - floats - boolean)

It's extremely easy to setup. Just include **random.hpp** file in your code!

Simple Example
--------------

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "random.hpp"

using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<< randint() << "\n";
}
```
### This code supports the giving of random numbers only in the current time and will be developed as soon as possible.
